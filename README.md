# Zero 2 Hero: CUDA Learning Projects

## Prerequisites
- C++ and CUDA basics
- cmake

## Learning Notes & Result Analysis
This section links to the detailed learning notes, performance analysis reports and implementation details of each subproject (stored in the `README.md` of the corresponding subproject directory).

### 1. CUDA Reduce (Parallel Reduction)
- **Learning Goal**: Master the implementation and optimization of parallel reduction in CUDA, understand thread hierarchy, memory access patterns and performance tuning.
- **Detailed Notes & Analysis**: [reduce subproject README](./01_Reduce/README.md)
- **Key Content**: 
  - CUDA kernel parallel reduction implementation (naive → optimized version)
